JMAP Organization, Great, Real, Exciting (yes ok, the backronym is a WIP,
along with the whole project)

---

An implementation of a JMAP server, aiming to be a modern alternative to
CalDAV/CardDAV servers.

Aiming to implement:

- [RFC 8620](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8620)
- [JMAP Calendars](https://jmap.io/spec-calendars.html)
- [JMAP Contacts](https://jmap.io/spec-contacts.html)

Will probably end up being a forever WIP, but we'll see!
